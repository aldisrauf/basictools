\title{Pattern Matching Using SQL-Like Syntax}
\usage{
x \%like\% pattern
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Character vector. The input vector to be searched.}

\item{pattern}{Character vector. The pattern(s) to search for. Use `%` as a wildcard at the start or end of the pattern to match any sequence of characters.}
}
\value{
A logical vector indicating whether each element of `x` matches any of the patterns.
}
\description{
This function performs pattern matching on character vectors using a syntax similar to SQL's `LIKE` operator. It supports the use of wildcards (`%`) at the beginning and/or end of the pattern to match any sequence of characters.
}
\examples{
# Check if elements contain "apple" anywhere in the string
c("apple", "banana", "grape") \%like\% "\%apple\%"

# Check if elements start with "ba"
c("apple", "banana", "grape") \%like\% "ba\%"

# Check if elements end with "pe"
c("apple", "banana", "grape") \%like\% "\%pe"
}
